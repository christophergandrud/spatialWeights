# spatialWeights

This R package is designed to implement some of the spatial weights for time series cross sectional data discussed in 
[Neumayer and Plumper (2010)](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/30750/1/Making%20spatial%20analysis%20operational(lsero).pdf).

Weights can be found in parallel for improved speed.

**NOTE:** I am working on it largely for a specific research project and do not (currently) intend to get it into shape for a CRAN release. I make it available here in case you are interested and want to build on it/find errors that I may have created.
