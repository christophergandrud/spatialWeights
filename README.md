[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/christophergandrud/spatialWeights.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/christophergandrud/spatialWeights)

This R package is designed to implement some of the spatial weights for time series cross sectional data discussed in 
[Neumayer and Plumper (2010)](http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/30750/1/Making%20spatial%20analysis%20operational(lsero).pdf).

Weights can be found in parallel for improved speed.
