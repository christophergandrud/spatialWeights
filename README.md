# spatialWeights

This R package is designed to implement some of the spatial weights discussed in Neumayer and Plumper (2010). 

**NOTE:** I am working on it largely for a specific research project and do not (currently) intend to get it into shape for a CRAN release. I make it available here in case you are interested and want to build on it/find errors that I may have created.
